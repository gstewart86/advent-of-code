# --- Day 8: Treetop Tree House ---
# The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a tree house.

# First, determine whether there is enough tree cover here to keep a tree house hidden. To do this, you need to count the number of trees that are visible from outside the grid when looking directly along a row or column.

# The Elves have already launched a quadcopter to generate a map with the height of each tree (your puzzle input). For example:

# 30373
# 25512
# 65332
# 33549
# 35390
# Each tree is represented as a single digit whose value is its height, where 0 is the shortest and 9 is the tallest.

# A tree is visible if all of the other trees between it and an edge of the grid are shorter than it. Only consider trees in the same row or column; that is, only look up, down, left, or right from any given tree.

# All of the trees around the edge of the grid are visible - since they are already on the edge, there are no trees to block the view. In this example, that only leaves the interior nine trees to consider:

# The top-left 5 is visible from the left and top. (It isn't visible from the right or bottom since other trees of height 5 are in the way.)
# The top-middle 5 is visible from the top and right.
# The top-right 1 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to only be trees of height 0 between it and an edge.
# The left-middle 5 is visible, but only from the right.
# The center 3 is not visible from any direction; for it to be visible, there would need to be only trees of at most height 2 between it and an edge.
# The right-middle 3 is visible from the right.
# In the bottom row, the middle 5 is visible, but the 3 and 4 are not.
# With 16 trees visible on the edge and another 5 visible in the interior, a total of 21 trees are visible in this arrangement.

# Consider your map; how many trees are visible from outside the grid?

# --- Part Two ---
# Content with the amount of tree cover available, the Elves just need to know the best spot to build their tree house: they would like to be able to see a lot of trees.

# To measure the viewing distance from a given tree, look up, down, left, and right from that tree; stop if you reach an edge or at the first tree that is the same height or taller than the tree under consideration. (If a tree is right on the edge, at least one of its viewing distances will be zero.)

# The Elves don't care about distant trees taller than those found by the rules above; the proposed tree house has large eaves to keep it dry, so they wouldn't be able to see higher than the tree house anyway.

# In the example above, consider the middle 5 in the second row:

# 30373
# 25512
# 65332
# 33549
# 35390
# Looking up, its view is not blocked; it can see 1 tree (of height 3).
# Looking left, its view is blocked immediately; it can see only 1 tree (of height 5, right next to it).
# Looking right, its view is not blocked; it can see 2 trees.
# Looking down, its view is blocked eventually; it can see 2 trees (one of height 3, then the tree of height 5 that blocks its view).
# A tree's scenic score is found by multiplying together its viewing distance in each of the four directions. For this tree, this is 4 (found by multiplying 1 * 1 * 2 * 2).

# However, you can do even better: consider the tree of height 5 in the middle of the fourth row:

# 30373
# 25512
# 65332
# 33549
# 35390
# Looking up, its view is blocked at 2 trees (by another tree with a height of 5).
# Looking left, its view is not blocked; it can see 2 trees.
# Looking down, its view is also not blocked; it can see 1 tree.
# Looking right, its view is blocked at 2 trees (by a massive tree of height 9).
# This tree's scenic score is 8 (2 * 2 * 1 * 2); this is the ideal spot for the tree house.

# Consider each tree on your map. What is the highest scenic score possible for any tree?
